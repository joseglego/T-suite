# T-suite
- [Espa√±ol](README-es.md)

## Idea
This project is a wide project based on [Tibia](https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=latestnews), which is a MMORPG from [Cipsoft](https://www.cipsoft.com/index.php/en/)

The main idea is build a general system based on simple components to explain step by step all the work related (FrontEnd, BackEnd, CLI, External & Internal Apps, Web Technologies).

I haven't play during last years. So, if you think I'm missing something or I should include something else feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/joseglego/T-suite/issues/new)

## Components
- [T-Scraper](./t-scraper/README.md)
- To be announced.

## Extra Information
This was just an idea, to practice, build and write notes. But, while I was doing the research related I found 2 projects already in production stage, which obviously give me some hints and help in the development of the idea and, in some cases even recommendation for code.:
- [Tibia Data API](https://tibiadata.com/)
- [Tibia GraphQL API](https://github.com/raulfdm/tibia-api)

Also, I discussed this with some friends and 2 mentors.
